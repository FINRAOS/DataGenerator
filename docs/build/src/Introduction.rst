Introduction to DataGenerator
=============================

Primary goals of test automation are increased coverage, decreased manual effort and flexibility to accommodate changing requirements.
DataGenerator is a testing tool that provides these goals. This tool supports requirements specification and test case specification in terms of work
flows and data equivalence classes. By using templates, the format of the test data produced is highly customizable, and has the ability to include
dynamically calculated test expectations. The combined use of straightforward specification inputs, tool-assured test case coverage, and
customizable output enables a tester to achieve increased coverage in less time, while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to requirements changes.
In an agile software development environment, modifications to the specification input and output templates are all that’s required to get the tests re-generated.
This reduces time spent on test case generation and requirements gathering and alleviates gaps between requirements and test cases generated which
strengthens behavior-driven development.
