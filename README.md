DataGenerator
=============

Major challenges in software testing are ensuring test coverage, reduction of test execution effort and flexibility to accommodate changing requirements. DataGenerator is a new testing tool that help solve these challenges. By enabling the specification of data equivalence classes and dependency modeling the DataGenerator allows the user to model the behavior or the requirements of a piece of software. Using templates, the format of the output produced is highly customizable, and has the ability to include dynamically calculated test expectations, test data or test scripts. The combined use of the specification inputs, tool-assured test case coverage, and customizable templates, enables a tester to achieve increased coverage in less time while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to requirements changes. In an agile software development environment, modifications to the specification input and output templates are all that is required to get the tests re-generated. Therefore, this reduces time spent on test case generation and requirements gathering and alleviates gaps between requirements and test cases generated enabling elements of behavior-driven development.
